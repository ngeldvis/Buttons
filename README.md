# Buttons
**Reference sheet** for different styles of buttons using **HTML** and **CSS**

> **Note:** Some of these buttons are buttons that I have found online or have seen being used on other websites, I do not claim all of these buttons to be my own

Feel free to submit your own styles in the **[discussions](https://github.com/ngeldvis/Buttons/discussions)** section!
